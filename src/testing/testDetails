1-Modular testing:
Test drivers & stubs:
a-)Test drivers:Test drivers call the code, check the results of MyProgram class with the  method of test driver
then we create a TestMyProgram class and this class has a main method and it this main method we called MyProgram.testDrivers().
its better that we move Main method to test driver class

b)Stubs:bits of code called by the code
being tested.
i)Fill in for missing method
ii)Determine whether bug lies in calling method or called by replacing callee stub.
iii)produce test data that real subroutines

produce repeatable test data.


2-Integration Testing:
Define interfaces well! No ambignity in description of behaviour

3-Result verification
a)Data structure integrity checkers
Inspect data structure & varifies that all invariants are satisfied.
b)Algorithms result checker.


Assertion:Code that tests an invariant or results example assert(x==3).
if x==3 then keep on testing code but if x!=3 then stop test.
turn them on: java -ea
turn them off: java -da


Regression testing:
Regression test is suite  that can be re-run when changes are made.
