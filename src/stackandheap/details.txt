The STACK AND THE HEAP
JAVA keeps most of the things that stores in variables and fields and elsewhere into different places 1-stack and 2-heap


Heap:heap  stores all the objects with no exception, including arrays, and all class variables.

Stack: stores all local variables, including parameters.

when a method is called, Java creates  a stack frame(aka activation records)
Stores the parameters &  local variables.

one method can call another method and so on...
and for that reason the jvm maintains an entire stack of stack frames.
When method finishes, its stack frame is erased.

Method:Thread.dumpstack() is a static method in thread class when whe called it's prints the all of the stack frames(in java.lang)

Parameter passing in java:
All parameters  by passed by value -Copied.
method cannot change the originals
