Tree:
Set of nodes & edges that connect them.
1-Exactly one path between and 2 nodes.

Path: Connected sequence of edges

Rooted Tree:
one distinguished node is called root.
Every node c, except root has one parent p,the first node on path from c to the root.

C is p's child.
Root has no parent.
A node can have any  # of children.

Leaf: Node with no children
Sibling: Node with same parent
Ancestors of a node d :
nodes on path from d to root,including d, d's parent ,d's grandparent,... root.

If a is an ancestor of d,then d is descesndant of a.
Length of Path: # of edges in path.

Depth of node n: length of path from n to root.
(Depth of root is zero.)

Height of a node n:
length of path from n to its deepest descendent.
(Height of any leaf is zero)

Height of a tree:
height of the root.

subtree rooted at n:
tree formed by n & its descendents.


*
A binary tree: no node has >2 children every child is a left child or a right child even if it's the only child.
