Traversal:
a manner of visiting each node in a tree once.

PreOrderTraversals:
visit each node before recursively visiting its children left to right.Root visited first


    node visited:
        1
     2     6
   3 4 5  7  8

* each node visited only once,so a pre order traversals takes o(n) time when n is # of nodes in tree.

Post Order traversals:
    visit each nodes children(left - to - right) before the node itself;


Binary trees: inOrder traversed:
visit left child, then node , then right child.

                +
             *     ^
           3  7   4  2

      InOrder: (3*7 + 4^2)

      PreOrder: + * 3 7 ^ 4 2

      PostOrder: 3 7 * 4 2 ^ +


     Level-Order traversal:

     visit root, then all depth-1 nodes (left to right), then all depth-2 nodes, etc.

     Level Order: " + * ^ 3 7 4 2"

     this is not recursive

     Use a queue, which initially contains only the root.
     Repeat:
            1- Deque a node
            2-Visit it
            3-Enqueue it's children ( left to right)

            Until queue is empty

          + * 3 7 4 2
          - - - - - -
            - - - - -
              - - - -
                - - -
                  - -
