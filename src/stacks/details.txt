STACKS
------
Operations:
 1-"push" new item into top of stack.
2-"pop" top item off stock (remove it).
3-examine "top" item of stack.

Easily implemented as singly-linked list.
All operations take o(1) time.

Sample application: Paranthesis matching
{[(){[]}]()}
Scan through String, char by char.
-lefty--- {,[,(: push onto stack.
righty: pop it's counter part off stack;
check that they match.

Mismatch or try to pop empty stack or stack not empty at end of String.
parantheses not properly matches.
