it's a little bit like a dictionary  in the sense that it also stores entries.

 entry consist of a key and Associated value.
 dictionary is used when we want to be able to lookup a particular key but a priority queue
 is something completely different when we want to prioritize  entries and each key is going
 to have either a numberical value or some other value that we can order like alphabetically or numerically.

A total order is defined on the keys. and the operations that a priority queue allows you to do.
there's 3 main ones.
Operations:
* Identify or remove entry whose key is lowest. (but no other entry)

* Insert anything we want at any time.(Any key may be inserted at any time)

Commonly used as "event queues" in simulation.
the idea is that there's a bunch of entries on the queue the key associated with each entry is the
time when the event is going to take place and the value associated with that key is what the
event is a description of the event that will take place.

Key is the time that the event takes place and the associated value is description of the event.
