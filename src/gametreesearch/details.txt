1-Assume both opponents are infinitely  intelligent
2-Each grid is assigned a numerical score that indicates how we are about winning.
assigned 1:computer is guaranteed a win.
assigned -1:opponent is guaranteed a win
assigned 0: if perfect players will draw.


for tic tak toe:
suppose computer is playing x:
X 's in a row:1
O 's in a row:-1'

no empty square nobody has won:0

Any other grid: computed by a minimax Algorithm


solve:
-consider each possible move
- Determine each child grid
- Score each child grid by calling minimax recursivly
-Score parent grid.

minimax algorithm:
Computers turn:choose move that yiled to maximum score
Opponent's turn:choose move that yield the minimum Score.


//
simple prunning:
if a player discover a gauranted winning move, There's no reason to search for a better move.
